## Course Requirements

### Project

You are expected to independently work on a project of your own design:
- code in the Python programming language.
- build a SQL database and interact with it using the SQLite Python API.
- have at least three tables.
- have at least one SQL statement containing at least two joins.
- create an interactive GUI using the Tkinter toolkit.
- bonus points: use github for version control.

### Weekly Reports

Each week, send a 150-word report on the work you did during the week.

### Presentation

You will give two in-class presentations:
- one 5-10 minute presentation to the class about the ideas, outline and goals
  of your project
- one final 10 minute presentation to the class about the project work, results
  and lessons, with a live demo. 

## Attendance

For attendance, each student is allowed five (5) absences for any reason except
on days when there are presentations or exams. Absences exceeding the allowance
or absence on a presentation day for any reason results in a 0.2% deduction
from the attendance grade.
    
## Academic Violations

Hunter College regards acts of academic dishonesty (e.g., plagiarism, cheating
on examinations, obtaining unfair advantage, and falsification of records and
official documents) as serious offenses against the values of intellectual
honesty. The college is committed to enforcing the CUNY Policy on Academic
Integrity and will pursue cases of academic dishonesty according to the Hunter
College Academic Integrity Procedures. Special attention is given to CONTRACT
CHEATING (this is where students have work completed on their behalf which is
then submitted for academic credit).

## Email

Emails to the instructor must be via a CUNY email addresses for FERPA reasons.

## Discussion and Q&A

This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TA, and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email team@piazza.com.
