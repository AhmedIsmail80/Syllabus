## Course Description

This course is intended to be an introductory survey course on the fundamental concepts and principles that underlie current and emerging methods, tools, and techniques for the cost-effective engineering of high-quality software systems. This may include the understanding and appreciation of problems in large-scale software development such as functional analysis of information processing systems, system design concepts, timing estimates, documentation and system testing. 

Software Engineering (SE) is concerned with all facets of software development, from the early stages of requirements engineering to maintaining the system after it has been deployed. This includes technical processes of software development as well as activities such as software project management and the development of tools, methods, and theories to support software development. This course is **not** a "programming" course, instead, it focuses on surveying some of the critical facets of SE that may be less familiar to students of computer science, such as identifying a development process appropriate to the circumstances, eliciting and documenting requirements, using reviews and inspections plus machine-based testing in software development, understanding software evolution in large, complex systems, issues associated with developing dependable software systems, and configuration management of large systems developed by multiple engineers.

## Outline and Schedule of Course Topics

The following topics will be covered in the given order. Please note that this schedule is tentative and is meant to serve only as a guide. "Handouts" means that notes and/or readings will be given in class. Although there are fourteen class meeting weeks, one week has been reserved for a midterm and final exam review.

## Course Requirements

### Project

You are expected to independently work on a project of your own design:
- code in the Python programming language.
- build a SQL database and interact with it using the SQLite Python API.
- have at least three tables.
- have at least one SQL statement containing at least two joins.
- create an interactive GUI using the Tkinter toolkit.
- bonus points: use github for version control.

### Presentation

You will give two in-class presentations:
- one 5-10 minute presentation to the class about the ideas, outline and goals
  of your project
- one final 10 minute presentation to the class about the project work, results
  and lessons, with a live demo. 

## Attendance

For attendance, each student is allowed five (5) absences for any reason except
on days when there are presentations or exams. Absences exceeding the allowance
or absence on a presentation day for any reason results in a 0.2% deduction
from the attendance grade.
    
## Academic Violations

Hunter College regards acts of academic dishonesty (e.g., plagiarism, cheating
on examinations, obtaining unfair advantage, and falsification of records and
official documents) as serious offenses against the values of intellectual
honesty. The college is committed to enforcing the CUNY Policy on Academic
Integrity and will pursue cases of academic dishonesty according to the Hunter
College Academic Integrity Procedures. Special attention is given to CONTRACT
CHEATING (this is where students have work completed on their behalf which is
then submitted for academic credit).

## Discussion and Q&A

This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates and myself. Rather than emailing questions to me, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email team@piazza.com.

## Email

Emails to the instructor must be via a CUNY email addresses for FERPA reasons. Please post all class-related discussion on Piazza. Also, please ensure that your *correct* email address is entered into the CUNY Blackboard.

## Special Needs

Students with special needs should see me for accommodation.

## ADA Compliance

In compliance with the American Disability Act of 1990 (ADA) and with Section
504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Hunter College is committed to ensuring
educational parity and accommodations for all students with documented
