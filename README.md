## Course Description

This first course for prospective computer science majors and minors concentrates on problem-solving techniques using a high-level programming language. The course includes a brief overview of computer systems.

## Pre-/Co-requisites

The prerequisite is CSCI 12700 or instructor’s permission. At the very least, you should have written, compiled, and run a >1 page program containing iteration (while/for) and selection (if) statements.

**CSCI 13600 is a co-requisite**, and you will not receive a grade in 13500 if you don't take 13600. If you have already passed 13600, you **must** contact the instructors before the second class, so that you can be added to a Bb section and your work can be graded.

## Questions

This term we will be using [Piazza](http://piazza.com/hunter.cuny) for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TAs, and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, please [email them](mailto:team@piazza.com).

Find our [class page](http://piazza.com/hunter.cuny/fall2017/csci13500/home) and [sign up](http://piazza.com/hunter.cuny/fall2017/csci13500) for the forum.

## Email

Emails to the instructor must be via a CUNY email addresses for FERPA reasons. Please post all class-related discussion on Piazza. Also, please ensure that your *correct* email address is entered into the CUNY Blackboard.

## Bulletin Board

You should check the [Blackboard](http://bb.hunter.cuny.edu) sites for both 13500 and 13600 regularly, since all class material will be posted there. Please make sure you have configured Bb to use your *Hunter email address*. You are responsible for any email the instructors might send there.

You are responsible for all the material on the reading list whether or not covered in lectures.

## Grading

- Programming Projects (3-5). This may not seem like a lot, but beware that many test questions will be based directly on these programs.
- Tests (3, equally weighted). Test 3 will be according to Hunter’s official final exam schedule for this class. This is currently scheduled for December 19, 5:20-7:20, but that is subject to change by the college.

Final grades will be assigned based on the above and the following guidelines:

average | grade | average
------- | ----- | -------
97.5 <= | A+    |
92.5 <= | A     | < 97.5
90   <= | A-    | < 92.5
87.5 <= | B+    | < 90
82.5 <= | B     | < 87.5
80 <=   | B-    | < 82.5
77.5 <= | C+    | < 80
70 <=   | C     | < 77.5
65 <=   | D     | < 70
0 <=    | F     | < 65

## Late Policy

Late penalties for programming projects are: 5% within 2 hours of the due date/time, 10% within 24 hours, and an additional 10% for each day after that. No homework is accepted after 1 week.

Make-up tests are not given under any circumstances. If there are extraordinary circumstances why you are unable to take a test, you must provide documentation *prior* to the test to avoid getting a zero.


## Software

The standard Linux/Unix/MacOS C++ compiler is g++. There are several free Linux OSs which you can install for Windows, including [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com), which is freely available in the [Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6). If you want a Linux-style environment for windows that doesn't require installing Linux, [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com) is an alternative. You will be able to ssh into "CSnet" to compile and run your programs in our Linux environment. The lab machines are the arbiter of "compile and run".


## Course Goals

This course is:

- An introduction to software development, using the C++ programming language. Software development is a skill involving understanding the problem being modeled, as well as expressing a solution using a programming language. Thus, it has both conceptual and technical components. The successful student will be able to clearly and logically transform a problem, while being comfortable with C++ to express the transformed problem.
- A preparation for further courses in computer science. This course comprises the ABCs of computer science, and you’re not allowed to forget it anymore than you can forget the alphabet after kindergarten. Students who expect to take more advanced courses in computer science need to go beyond “understanding” the material presented in this course – they need to master it.
- Time consuming; very, very time consuming. Any programming course takes up a lot of a student’s time. In addition to the time spent in class, most students will need to spend between 10 and 20 hours a week at a computer. That makes for a total of 15-25 hours a week – that’s 15-25 hours a week you must dedicate JUST FOR THIS COURSE, no kidding!

This course is NOT:

- An introduction to computers in general. We will not cover: Linux, networks, databases, etc. This course teaches a specialized skill – programming – and only programming. You should already possess basic computer skills such as compiling simple computer programs, editing files, manipulating files, etc.
- An overview of the C++ language. C++ is a huge language with a lot of highly technical details. We will cover the fundamentals of C++, but the focus is on designing algorithms and solving problems.
- A good idea to take if you are working full time and taking a full course load, or, for any other reason(s) you don't have a lot of free time to devote to CSCI 13500. Although much of the material isn't especially difficult, it usually requires many, many hours to master. It is difficult to understand software development concepts without sitting in front of a computer many hours a week actually writing and debugging programs. Be honest with yourself. Make sure this course is for you, – now – at this point in your academic life. If you would like to discuss the time requirements further please feel free to come talk with the instructors.

This course provides a 'first step' towards the following department's **learning goals**:

- Have a deep practical knowledge of one widely used programming language
- Be experienced in working in at least two widely used operating system environments
- Be able to apply principles of design and analysis in creating substantial programs and have experience working in teams on projects of moderately realistic scope.

## How to Learn

- From the beginning, students will be expected to work independently outside of the lectures. There will be very little "hand holding" in the course – you are expected to find your way around your computer on your own. For example, the way each of you will save your work, compile/debug an assignment, etc., will vary. These techniques will not be covered in class. Get started NOW (especially if you are going to install your own compiler and/or OS software). The first programming project is due soon.
- There will be many obstacles to overcome, both in absorbing the many examples of C++ programs and in doing the assignments. Attacking the obstacles head on, outside of class time, in front of a computer, is the key to success. Keep trying, if your program is not working, try again. Still not working? Try again. And again. And again. When it comes to programming, the learning is in the doing. There is no substitute for spending many hours in front of a computer – trying and failing, trying and failing, trying and failing – until you finally get your program up and running correctly. Every time you fail, you actually learn quite a bit, and to pass the course, you will repeat this trying-failing cycle many times, every week of every month during the entire semester. There are virtually no "slow points" during the semester.

- There will be approximately four programming projects. By far, the main cause for an unsatisfactory final grade is falling behind on the assignments. Exams are largely based on the programming assignments. If you don't do the assignments, on time, you will almost certainly not pass the tests.

## Outline and Schedule of Course Topics

The instructor will maintain a separate [course schedule](https://gist.github.com/khatchad/08554763867c0490e6100a4b4ce9302c). 

## Key Dates

Event | Date

Withdrawal Deadline | November 10
Final Exam | December 19 5:20-7:20 pm in West Building 714

### Notes

- We ask that all cell phones, pagers, etc., be silent in class. Any electronics in use should be used for class related activities. Violations of these requests will result in the loss of 2 points from you final average (per occurrence).
- Assignments are the result of **individual effort**. We take **academic honesty** very seriously, and any violation results in an **automatic F for the course** along with sanctions in accordance with Hunter College procedure.

## Academic Violations

Hunter College regards acts of academic dishonesty (e.g., plagiarism, cheating on examinations, obtaining unfair advantage, and falsification of records and official documents) as serious offenses against the values of intellectual honesty. The college is committed to enforcing the CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity and will pursue cases of academic dishonesty according to the Hunter College Academic Integrity Procedures. Special attention is given to CONTRACT CHEATING (this is where students have work completed on their behalf which is then submitted for academic credit).

## Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) 

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education.

FERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children's education records. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school level. Students to whom the rights have transferred are "eligible students."

- Parents or eligible students have the right to inspect and review the student's education records maintained by the school. Schools are not required to provide copies of records unless, for reasons such as great distance, it is impossible for parents or eligible students to review the records. Schools may charge a fee for copies.
- Parents or eligible students have the right to request that a school correct records which they believe to be inaccurate or misleading. If the school decides not to amend the record, the parent or eligible student then has the right to a formal hearing. After the hearing, if the school still decides not to amend the record, the parent or eligible student has the right to place a statement with the record setting forth his or her view about the contested information.
- Generally, schools must have written permission from the parent or eligible student in order to release any information from a student's education record. However, FERPA allows schools to disclose those records, without consent, to the following parties or under the following conditions (34 CFR § 99.31):
    - School officials with legitimate educational interest;
    - Other schools to which a student is transferring;
    - Specified officials for audit or evaluation purposes;
    - Appropriate parties in connection with financial aid to a student;
    - Organizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of the school;
    - Accrediting organizations;
    - To comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena; 
    - Appropriate officials in cases of health and safety emergencies; and
    - State and local authorities, within a juvenile justice system, pursuant
      to specific State law.

Schools may disclose, without consent, "directory" information such as a student's name, address, telephone number, date and place of birth, honors and awards, and dates of attendance. However, schools must tell parents and eligible students about directory information and allow parents and eligible students a reasonable amount of time to request that the school not disclose directory information about them. Schools must notify parents and eligible students annually of their rights under FERPA. The actual means of notification (special letter, inclusion in a PTA bulletin, student handbook, or newspaper article) is left to the discretion of each school.
