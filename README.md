## Course Description

This course introduces students to the fundamentals of dynamic web application
software development.  It provides instruction in building web pages
dynamically, organizing projects into web applications, and deploying these
applications using a web server.  The course investigates the role middleware
in an N-tiered design structure (acting as a middle layer between requests
coming from Web browsers or other HTTP clients and databases or applications on
the HTTP server).  The concepts of web frameworks, life cycles, handling client
requests, generating server responses, handling cookies, session tracking, and
the MVC (model-view-controller) architecture will be discussed.  Hands-on
laboratory exercises will reinforce the material presented in the lectures and
enable students to develop related programming, critical thinking, and problem
solving skills. Students will also learn how to develop complicated software in
teams.

## Course Objectives

Upon successful completion of the course, the student should be able to:

1. Demonstrate understanding of dynamic web application development.
1. Demonstrate understanding of dealing with form data from client requests.
1. Demonstrate understanding of various HTTP request headers, and how to access
   them from a client request.
1. Demonstrate understanding of the meaning, format, and means of setting HTTP
   response codes/headers.
1. Demonstrate understanding of how to send and receive cookies, their benefits
   and drawbacks, and differences between session and persistent cookies.
1. Demonstrate understanding of the various elements of session tracking and
   the Java session tracking API.
1. Demonstrate understanding of the syntax and utility of web frameworks.
1. Demonstrate understanding of invoking server-side code with client-side
   scripting elements.
1. Use of server-side components/objects, state, and their life cycle.
1. Understand the Model View Controller (MVC) Architecture/design pattern.

    - If you need a refresher, I recommend [*Core Java for the
      Impatient*](http://books.google.com/books/about/Core_Java_for_the_Impatient.html?id=hA9KngEACAAJ)
      by [Cay S. Horstmann](http://www.horstmann.com).
- Knowledge of the [Hypertext Transfer Protocol
  (HTTP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)
- Knowledge of
  [Model–view–controller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–controller)

## Optional Tasks 

1. Please sign up for a free Amazon Web Services (AWS) student account at
http://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/apply. Choose the *students* option.
I will use AWS to deploy our example applications. You may also run a local web
server if you wish.
1. Please join the [GitHub organization](http://github.com/cst4713-d766) for our course for coding discussion.
1. Please join the [OpenLab course](http://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/groups/cst4713-dynamic-web-development-servlet-and-jsp-sp2016/) for class discussion.

## Attendance

Attendance is expected at every class meeting.  College policy sets the maximum
number of permissible absences at 10% of the number of class meetings scheduled
for the semester.  If the class is meeting two times per week, you are
    permitted to be absent a total of three class sessions; if the class meets
    only once per week, you are permitted to miss one and one-half of the class
    meetings. A student who is absent for more than 15% of the class
    hours in the semester will be assigned a grade of WU (withdrew
    unofficially), subject to the discretion of the instructor. Fifteen percent
    equals eight hours for a course that meets four hours a week, six hours for
    a course that meets three hours a week. A student who does not attend a
    course at all will be assigned a grade of WN (never attended).
    
## Academic Violations

The instructor of the course has the authority to give a grade of **F** if the
student submits the work of another person in a manner that represents his/her
work, or knowingly permits one’s work to be submitted by another person without
the instructor’s permission. Please see the [CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity](http://www.citytech.cuny.edu/aboutus/docs/policies/CUNY_ACADEMIC_INTEGRITY_6-2011.pdf) for more details. The instructor is required to **report all violations to the college**.

## Grading

Category | Percentage
-------- | ----------
Assignments (individual) | 40% 
Final Project (group) | 30% 
Nanoquizzes & Participation | 10%
Coding & Design Work | 20%

For most class sessions, you will be asked to read one or more short articles
in advance. The class will begin with a tiny "nanoquiz" comprising a few
multiple choice questions about the readings.

The measure of the acquired skills in coding and design work will be computed
by selecting the best grades received for the design and code portions of the
assignments.

Letter Grade | Numerical Grade
------------ | ---------------
A | 93-100
A- | 90-92.9
B+ | 87-89.9
B | 83-86.9
B- | 80-82.9
C+ | 77-79.9
C | 70-76.9
D | 60-69.9
F | <=59.9

## Notes

- **Deadlines** and **due dates** for assignments will be assigned in class.
- **Late assignments will be penalized.**
- Assignments are the result of **individual effort unless otherwise specified** (e.g., group projects). Note that the instructor is required to **report all violations to the college**.
- Group projects are the result of **group effort by the particular group only**.
- Plagiarism will not be tolerated. Copying code from the internet is a form of
  plagiarism.
- Students found cheating and/or plagiarizing will receive a grade of 0 for the
  corresponding grade item and will be reported to the college.  
- If you miss a class, you are responsible for the material.  Have the phone
  numbers of several other students to find out what material you missed
- Homework submissions are not accepted via email.
- Any emails sent from the instructor via non-CUNY email addresses will be ignored.

## Grade Requirement

## Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) 

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34
CFR Part 99) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education
records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable
program of the U.S. Department of Education.

FERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children's education
records. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of
18 or attends a school beyond the high school level. Students to whom the
rights have transferred are "eligible students."

- Parents or eligible students have the right to inspect and review the
  student's education records maintained by the school. Schools are not
  required to provide copies of records unless, for reasons such as great
  distance, it is impossible for parents or eligible students to review the
  records. Schools may charge a fee for copies.
- Parents or eligible students have the right to request that a school correct
  records which they believe to be inaccurate or misleading. If the school
  decides not to amend the record, the parent or eligible student then has the
  right to a formal hearing. After the hearing, if the school still decides not
  to amend the record, the parent or eligible student has the right to place a
  statement with the record setting forth his or her view about the contested
  information.
- Generally, schools must have written permission from the parent or eligible
  student in order to release any information from a student's education
  record. However, FERPA allows schools to disclose those records, without
  consent, to the following parties or under the following conditions (34 CFR §
  99.31):
    - School officials with legitimate educational interest;
    - Other schools to which a student is transferring;
    - Specified officials for audit or evaluation purposes;
    - Appropriate parties in connection with financial aid to a student;
    - Organizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of the school;
    - Accrediting organizations;
    - To comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena; 
    - Appropriate officials in cases of health and safety emergencies; and
    - State and local authorities, within a juvenile justice system, pursuant
      to specific State law.

Schools may disclose, without consent, "directory" information such as a
student's name, address, telephone number, date and place of birth, honors and
awards, and dates of attendance. However, schools must tell parents and
eligible students about directory information and allow parents and eligible
students a reasonable amount of time to request that the school not disclose
directory information about them. Schools must notify parents and eligible
students annually of their rights under FERPA. The actual means of notification
(special letter, inclusion in a PTA bulletin, student handbook, or newspaper
article) is left to the discretion of each school.
