## Course Description

This course will cover how the Java language can support applications on mobile
devices as cell phones, PDAs and other small computational devices. Students
will learn the strengths and limitations software development on small devices.
Specific topics will include  configurations and profiles; overview of
programming mobile devices; standard and custom user interface elements and
events; record stores and persistence; drawing and animation using game APIs
and 3D APIs; audio and video APIs; comparison of current technologies. At the
conclusion of the course, the student will be familiar with a special set of
Java classes designed to work on mobile devices and interact with multimedia
files.

## Course Objectives
Upon successful completion of the course, the student should be able to:

1. Understand the development environment on small remote devices.
2. Familiarized with `Activities`, the building block of Android for cell phone
   and multimedia applications.
3. Create simple applications to illustrate the concepts of abstract and
   discovered components in graphical user interfaces, commands, and event
   handling.
4. Appreciate complexities/challenges in moving large multimedia files to/from
   databases.
5. Develop software accessing databases, move large multimedia files to remote
   platforms.
6. Describe the strengths and weaknesses of applications deployed on remote
   devices.
7. Understand the Android event model and `Activity` life-cycle.

## General Education Outcomes
- **Skills/Inquiry/Analysis:** Students will employ scientific reasoning and
  logical thinking.
- **Skills/Communication:** Students will communicate in diverse settings and
  groups, using written (both reading and writing), oral (both speaking and
  listening), and visual means
- **Values/Ethics/Relationships/Professional/Personal Development:** Students
  will work with teams, including those of diverse composition. Build
  consensus.  Respect and use creativity.

## Prerequisite 

- CST 1201: Programming Fundamentals.
- CST 1204: Databases Fundamentals.

## Background Recommendation

- Good working knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
    - If you need a Java refresher, I recommend [*Core Java for the
      Impatient*](http://books.google.com/books/about/Core_Java_for_the_Impatient.html?id=hA9KngEACAAJ)
      by [Cay S. Horstmann](http://www.horstmann.com).
- Some XML experience is helpful but not required.

## Useful Material

- [Android Developers website](https://developer.android.com/develop)
    - Google's center for all things Android.

## Academic Violations

The instructor of the course has the authority to give a grade of **F** if the
student submits the work of another person in a manner that represents his/her
work, or knowingly permits one’s work to be submitted by another person without
the instructor’s permission. Please see the [CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity](http://www.citytech.cuny.edu/aboutus/docs/policies/CUNY_ACADEMIC_INTEGRITY_6-2011.pdf) for more details. The instructor is required to **report all violations to the college**.

## Notes

- **Deadlines** and **due dates** for assignments will be assigned in class.
- **Late assignments will be penalized.**
- Assignments are the result of **individual effort unless otherwise specified** (e.g., group projects). Note that the instructor is required to **report all violations to the college**.
- Tests are 60 minutes.
- Test make-ups will be given if only if:
    - the request is made sufficiently in advance of the test, and
    - the make-up is scheduled prior to the next class.
- No make-ups will be given for quizzes.
- Homework submissions are not accepted via email.

## Grade Requirement

All majors in CST, CIS, MS, and CIB must attain a grade of C or better in all
MS and CS courses

## Special Needs
Students with special needs should see me for accommodation.

## Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) 

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34
CFR Part 99) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education
records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable
program of the U.S. Department of Education.

FERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children's education
records. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of
18 or attends a school beyond the high school level. Students to whom the
rights have transferred are "eligible students."

- Parents or eligible students have the right to inspect and review the
  student's education records maintained by the school. Schools are not
  required to provide copies of records unless, for reasons such as great
  distance, it is impossible for parents or eligible students to review the
  records. Schools may charge a fee for copies.
- Parents or eligible students have the right to request that a school correct
  records which they believe to be inaccurate or misleading. If the school
  decides not to amend the record, the parent or eligible student then has the
  right to a formal hearing. After the hearing, if the school still decides not
  to amend the record, the parent or eligible student has the right to place a
  statement with the record setting forth his or her view about the contested
  information.
- Generally, schools must have written permission from the parent or eligible
  student in order to release any information from a student's education
  record. However, FERPA allows schools to disclose those records, without
  consent, to the following parties or under the following conditions (34 CFR §
  99.31):
    - School officials with legitimate educational interest;
    - Other schools to which a student is transferring;
    - Specified officials for audit or evaluation purposes;
    - Appropriate parties in connection with financial aid to a student;
    - Organizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of the school;
    - Accrediting organizations;
    - To comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena; 
    - Appropriate officials in cases of health and safety emergencies; and
    - State and local authorities, within a juvenile justice system, pursuant
      to specific State law.

Schools may disclose, without consent, "directory" information such as a
student's name, address, telephone number, date and place of birth, honors and
awards, and dates of attendance. However, schools must tell parents and
eligible students about directory information and allow parents and eligible
students a reasonable amount of time to request that the school not disclose
directory information about them. Schools must notify parents and eligible
students annually of their rights under FERPA. The actual means of notification
(special letter, inclusion in a PTA bulletin, student handbook, or newspaper
article) is left to the discretion of each school.
